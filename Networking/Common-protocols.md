Common protocols are essential for enabling communication and data transfer between devices on a network. These protocols define the rules and formats for how data is exchaged. This ensures that devices can understand processinformation correctly. The common protocols include:
## TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocols/ Internet Protocol);
     This is the foundation of the internet, defining how data is broken into packets, routed, and reassembled at the destination. it ensures reliable and error free data transmission.
## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol);
     This protocol is used for web communication, enabling the transfer of web pages and other data between browsers and web servers.
## HTTPs (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure);
A secure version of HTTP that encrypts data during transmission, protecting sensitive information like passwords and credit card details.
## FTP (File Transfer Protocol);
 Used for transferring files between computers, particularly for large files and in situations where secure file transfers are not required.
## DNS (Domain Name System);
It translates human friendly domain names like www.example.com into IP addresses that computers use to idenntify each other.
## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol);
Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, simplifying network configuration and allowing devices to dynamically change their IP addresses. 
## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
Used for sending emails from mail clients to mail servers. 
## POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):
Used for receiving emails from mail servers to mail clients. 
## SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):
Used for managing and monitoring network devices, allowing network administrators to collect data and configure devices remotely. 
## SSH (Secure Shell):
Provides a secure encrypted channel for remote access to a computer, protecting against eavesdropping. 
## UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
A connectionless protocol that prioritizes speed over reliability, making it suitable for applications like video streaming and online gaming where some data loss is acceptable. 
## ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
Used for network diagnostics and error reporting, helping administrators troubleshoot network issues. 
## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing computers to find each other within a network. 
## IEEE 802.1Q:
A standard for VLAN (Virtual LAN) tagging, used to segment a network into logical groups for security and management purposes. 
## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):
Prevents network loops in bridged networks, ensuring that data is transmitted reliably.
